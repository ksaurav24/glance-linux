"""`glancectl setup-pam` — wire pam_glance into the lock screen, and only there.

Omarchy has had two lock screens, and both talk PAM:

* **hyprlock** — `/etc/pam.d/hyprlock`. Auth runs when the user presses
  Enter. With `ignore_empty_input = false` in hyprlock.conf, an empty Enter
  is enough to trigger a face scan.
* **The Omarchy shell lock** (Quickshell) — `/etc/pam.d/omarchy-lock-password`
  for the typed password, and, only when a fingerprint is enrolled,
  `/etc/pam.d/omarchy-lock-fingerprint`, which the shell starts *by itself*
  the moment the screen locks and retries until it succeeds. The shell drops
  an empty password before it reaches PAM, so on the password stack a face
  scan needs any character plus Enter.

Two placements, then:

* **on demand** (default): `auth sufficient pam_glance.so` at the top of the
  password stack(s). The camera only runs when you ask. This is Howdy's model.
* **hands-free** (`--hands-free`): the same line ahead of `pam_fprintd.so` in
  the shell's fingerprint stack. The shell scans your face as soon as it
  locks and again after every fingerprint timeout, so the camera cycles for
  as long as the screen stays locked. Needs an enrolled fingerprint, because
  that is what makes the shell run the stack at all.

Every edit is idempotent, keeps a `.glance-backup` beside the file, and goes
through `sudo` one file at a time so the terminal shows exactly what is being
touched. `--remove` strips the line from every stack again.
