"""Enrollment: turn a few seconds of webcam into an encrypted set of embeddings.

No image is ever written. Each capture is aligned, embedded, and the frame is
gone; what lands on disk is N rows of 512 floats under AES-256-GCM.

Captures are spaced out in time and the user is asked to move between them,
because several near-identical embeddings add nothing: the point of multiple
rows per identity is to cover glasses, beard, lighting, and pose.
