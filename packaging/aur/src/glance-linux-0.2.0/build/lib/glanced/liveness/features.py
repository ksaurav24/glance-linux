"""The landmarker-facing half of liveness: turns one detected face (plus the
camera frames it came from) into a :class:`LivenessFrame` — plain points and
scalars, which is all the cue functions ever see.

Port of `glance/Liveness/LivenessFeatures.swift`, plus the Vision-facing
accessors from `LandmarkGeometry.swift` (`imagePoints`, `region`, `allPoints`,
`interocularDistance`, `eyeCenter`), which belong on this side of the split.

Keeping the landmarker-facing extraction isolated to this one file is what lets
the decision logic run standalone against synthetic data with no MediaPipe,
ONNX, or camera in the dependency chain.

MediaPipe FaceMesh has no named regions — it emits a fixed 478-point topology —
so the region index groups below stand in for Vision's named accessors. Two
consequences worth knowing:

* Correspondence across frames is *guaranteed* here, where upstream has to
  defend against Vision dropping a region between frames. The per-region count
  checks in `planar.py` are kept anyway; they cost nothing and a future
  landmarker may not be so well-behaved.
* MEDIAN_LINE is narrowed relative to Vision's. Vision's median line runs
  forehead to chin, but `planar.PROBE_REGIONS` requires probe points to sit
  geometrically *inside* the fit hull (eyes, eyebrows, outer lips) so that
  leftover error reads as depth rather than extrapolation. Forehead and chin
  points are outside that hull, so only the two midline points between the brow
  and lip lines are used.
