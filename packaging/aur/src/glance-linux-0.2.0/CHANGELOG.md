# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-18

First release under `ayandexyz`. Everything below is relative to 0.1.1.

### Added
- **Lockout.** Five consecutive failed scans with a face in view put the
  daemon into a five-minute refusal (`Outcome.LOCKED_OUT`), so a hands-free
  lock screen cannot be used for unlimited attempts. Empty-room, camera-error
  and not-armed scans do not count. `glancectl daemon --max-failures`,
  `--lockout`; `failures` and `lockedOut` on the status socket.
- **`glancectl setup-lock`.** Applies the Face ID-style lock screen indicator
  and installs an Omarchy `post-update` hook that re-applies it after
  `omarchy update`, from the package's root-owned copy only. `--remove`
  restores the stock files and drops the hook.
- The status socket and `glancectl status` report whether the indicator is
  applied and whether the hook is installed; the bar panel shows it and offers
  `setup-lock` as the last setup step.
- `SECURITY.md` with the threat model, including the user-session trust
  boundary the daemon has today.
- CI: pytest, the PAM module build, the plugin's JS tests and a manifest
  check on every push.

### Changed
- Plugin id is `io.github.ayandexyz.glance`; repositories live under
  `github.com/ayandexyz`.
- `apply.sh` refreshes its `.orig` backup whenever the file it is replacing is
  not already patched, so a revert after an Omarchy update restores that
  update's stock file rather than an older one.
- The AUR package ships `patches/omarchy-lock-faceid/` and the hook under
  `/usr/share/glanced/`.

### Removed
- `public/fonts/` and `.vscode/` — artifacts of a malware injection into the
  0.1.x history (see commit history of `b335940`), which never belonged to
  this project. The history pushed to `ayandexyz` has them purged.

## 0.1.1

Liveness model, daemon, `glancectl`, `pam_glance`, guided enrollment, the
Omarchy bar widget and the lock screen indicator patch.
