"""Camera frame -> everything the pipeline wants from it.

One object owns the landmarker and the embedder, and turns a native camera
frame into a `LivenessFrame` plus (optionally) an ArcFace embedding. The
daemon's unlock scan, enrollment, and `glancectl live` all go through here, so
the working-resolution rules in `camera.py` are applied in exactly one place.
