# Face ID-style indicator for the Omarchy lock screen

A pill that drops from the top of the lock screen while a face PAM module is
scanning. It springs open on the Omarchy mark, morphs into **a live view of
the camera** inside a sweeping ring, and closes into a tick on success. There
is no text anywhere in it: the mark says whose lock screen this is, the ring
says it is looking, the tick says it worked.

The motion is Glance's, ported from `NotchOverlay/NotchOverlayView.swift` in
the macOS app.

This is a patch to Omarchy's own lock plugin (`shell/plugins/lock/`), because
nothing outside the session-lock surface can draw over it. It is the shape of
an upstream change, previewed locally. An Omarchy update overwrites it —
which is why `glancectl setup-lock` is the way to apply it rather than
`apply.sh` by hand: it also installs a `post-update` hook
(`packaging/hooks/repair-glance-lock.hook`) that puts the patch back at the
end of `omarchy update`, from the root-owned copy the `glanced` package
installs under `/usr/share/glanced/lock-faceid/`. From a source checkout the
hook only notifies; the daemon's status (and the bar panel) shows whether the
patch is currently applied either way. `glancectl setup-lock --remove` runs
`revert.sh` and drops the hook.

## How it knows a scan is happening

`pam_glance` sends a PAM info message (`Glance: look at the camera`) before it
opens the camera. The lock's password `PamContext` already receives every
message; the patch watches for that prefix:

| PAM event | indicator |
|---|---|
| info message starting `Glance:` | `scanning` — pill drops in, opens on the mark, then the ring and the camera |
| conversation completes with success while scanning | `success` — ring closes, tick pops, unlock 550 ms later. A success that arrives under 1.4 s into the scan waits for the pill to finish arriving first, so a fast scan is not a flash |
| PAM moves on to the password prompt | `failure` — red ring, shake, hides after 1.2 s; password checked as usual |

No polling, no socket, and any module that announces itself the same way
(howdy could) gets the indicator for free.

## The motion, and why it is copied exactly

Two things carry over from upstream, and both are about the *choreography*
rather than the drawing:

**The slide and the expansion are separate timelines.** Coming in, the pill
slides down first and its size follows 160 ms later; going out it contracts
first and leaves 180 ms later. Moving both together reads as a box changing
size. Staggering them reads as an object arriving. Upstream hit the same wall
in SwiftUI and solved it the same way, with two independently mutated state
mirrors rather than one animated transition.

**The springs are asymmetric.** A little overshoot opening (upstream's
`spring(response: 0.45, damping: 0.7)`), none closing (`damping: 1.0`).
Arriving feels eager, leaving feels deliberate.

The mark is a square, so every footprint is a rounded square: the contracted
bar, the open panel, the camera view and the progress outline share one corner
treatment, stepped down by each inset so the radii stay concentric. The shape
never changes as the pill grows — only its size does.

The verdict is the one exception. As the sweep closes, the pill and the
outline round together into a full circle around the tick or the cross: the
square was the frame for a face, the circle is a badge. The mark and the
camera view, which only ever show while it is looking, stay square.

## The Omarchy mark

The square logo mark, taken from `icon.png`, which Omarchy already ships at
`$OMARCHY_PATH` — so there is nothing to download and it works offline.

The shipped file is one flat colour on transparent, and no hue-based tint can
move a flat colour anywhere. It is coloured instead by masking a rectangle of
the current theme's own foreground with the mark's alpha, which means it
follows a theme change with no per-theme asset. The brand page's pre-coloured
variants (`omarchy-logo-rose-pine.svg` and friends) are pinned to one palette
and would not do that.

It holds the pill for 750 ms, counted from the moment the pill starts to open
rather than from the start of the scan — long enough to register once it has
actually arrived, short enough that it is never standing between the user and
their session — and the camera polling runs underneath it, so a frame is ready
the instant the ring appears.

## The live view

The lock screen cannot capture it: the daemon holds the camera for the whole
scan, and V4L2 will not give a second process a stream. So the daemon
publishes each frame instead, and the indicator polls it at 15fps.

The published frame is a 192px square crop that follows the face box,
mirrored (an unmirrored preview of your own face moves the wrong way when you
lean), JPEG quality 70, about 5KB. It is written to
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/glance/preview.jpg`, which means:

- on tmpfs, so no frame ever reaches the disk;
- mode 0600 inside a 0700 directory, so no other user can read it;
- replaced atomically, so the indicator never renders half a frame;
- deleted when the scan ends, and again when the daemon starts, so a crash
  cannot leave a picture of your face behind.

Two images alternate in the indicator, and the newly loaded one is only shown
once it has decoded, so the view never blinks between frames. Until the first
frame lands — and if the daemon is not running, or previews are off — the face
glyph stands in, so the indicator never depends on the preview existing.

Turn it off entirely with `glancectl daemon --no-preview` (edit the
`ExecStart=` line in `~/.config/systemd/user/glanced.service`). The indicator
then simply keeps the glyph.

## The unlock afterglow

The lock surface is destroyed the instant the session unlocks, so a check mark
drawn on it disappears at exactly the moment it is doing its job, and the
unlock ends on a blink. The patch carries the capsule across that boundary
with a second, click-through layer-shell window that outlives the lock:

| | |
|---|---|
| PAM returns success | ring closes, check mark pops on the lock surface; the afterglow window is raised *behind* it |
| after 550 ms | the lock drops, revealing the afterglow already painted and in place |
| held 900 ms | the same capsule, in the same pixel position, now on the desktop |
| 420 ms | slides up and fades, window destroyed |

The window is raised at the verdict rather than at the unlock because a
layer-shell window is not on screen when it is asked for: it has to be
created, configured and painted, which measured 60-230 ms on this machine,
while the lock surface is destroyed in the same turn as the request. Raising
it at the unlock leaves a stretch with neither on screen, and the capsule
visibly vanishes and pops back. A session lock surface renders above every
layer-shell layer, so a window raised early is simply invisible until the lock
drops and reveals it.

The session comes back sooner than it did before this (550 ms rather than
800 ms), because the confirmation no longer has to finish before the unlock —
the rest of it happens on the far side, where it costs the user nothing.

The afterglow copy takes no keyboard focus and has an empty input region, so
every click passes straight through it. It is drawn with the notification
colours rather than the lock ones: `lock.*` is translucent by design, tuned to
sit on a blurred wallpaper, and over the desktop that leaves terminal text
legible through the words.

On a multi-monitor setup the afterglow appears on one screen while the lock
covers all of them, the same way the existing lock preview window behaves.
